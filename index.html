            <p>Hello! My name is Emily Juliao, I am from Miami, FL but I am currently living in Virginia. I miss the warm weather but I have enjoyed the beautiful seasons Virginia has to offer. I enjoy being outdoors, playing sports, drawing, and eating good food. I am excited to learn more about web development and software programming. I enjoy creating things and seeing them come to life!</p>
